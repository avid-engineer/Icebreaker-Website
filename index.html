                        <h2 class="font-bold grid place-items-center">Running and Hiking</h3> 
                        <p>I love going on runs and hikes with my dogs or alone if I can't take them with me. I usually go for one or two miles each day.</p>

                          <h2 class="font-bold grid place-items-center">Languages</h3>
                          <p>I enjoy learning languages. My native languages are Spanish and English, even though I learned Spanish first. I can also speak German pretty well; however I am not yet somewhere I would call myself fluent in this language. I am also interested in Russian, French and a lot of other ones.
                          </p>

                        <h2 class="font-bold grid place-items-center">Reading</h3>
                        <p>Reading recently became a favorite hobby for me. I now enjoy it more than watching TV. This month I read Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" and "The Doors of Perception", and Herman Hesse's "Siddhartha". I am currently reading the book in the picture, "Brothers of Auschwitz", by Malka Adler. I have not read the books in the pictures but would love to one day. </p>

                          <p>This is my first dog Tank. Tank is 2 years old and about to turn 3 in February. He is super friendly with people and other pets, playful, and loves walks and runs.</p>

                          <p>This is my second dog Lucas. Originally my mom's dog, he was given to me after another one of her dogs had a litter. Lucas is friendly but only with people, and loves walks and runs.</p>
